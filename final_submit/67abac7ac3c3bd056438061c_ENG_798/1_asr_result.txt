Okay, thank you for your advice. I'd like to ask you specifically about vaccinations. I've heard that the HPV vaccine is maybe something to think about, but I'm uncertain about whether it's necessary for my daughter at her current age. So I wondered if you could clarify the importance of the vaccine and when it would be appropriate to have it.
