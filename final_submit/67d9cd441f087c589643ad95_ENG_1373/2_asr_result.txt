No, it's been a while. I did go as part of physiotherapy after all the surgery and stuff, but like since then, no, and I kind of find it painful and difficult to keep up with the exercises I was told to do. I think there's a connection between like spinal cord injuries and mental health, but could it go from my spinal cord up into my brain?
