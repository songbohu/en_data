Hi there, nice to meet you! I'd like to ask you some questions about vaccinations. So, I've been hearing a lot of mixed opinions about vaccines at the moment, and so I'm kind of confused now, so I was wondering if you could give me any guidance on whether getting vaccinated is a good idea or not, whether that's the right choice for me.
