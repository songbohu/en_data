Okay, interesting. Yeah, I didn't know that. Thank you. Could you explain though to me why we still need vaccines now for diseases that are really rare, like the really obscure ones that no one has anymore? Could you explain why do we still need vaccinations for those things then, or just vaccinations in general? Why do we even need that now?
