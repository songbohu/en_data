Thank you. You're much more understanding than my doctor who tells me not to eat chocolate. And I tell him, don't tell me how to live. Oh, I have heard that some people who have COVID before are still advised to get vaccinated. Should I get vaccinated for this? Like if I get COVID, would I get vaccinated again or would I be done with the vaccines forever?
