Thanks for the information about the doctor. I'll try and set up an appointment to register. And I've got a question about any vaccinations. I've been given a few vaccinations in my home country but I'm not sure if there are any specific illnesses here that I need to worry about and if my vaccinations need to be updated for this country.
