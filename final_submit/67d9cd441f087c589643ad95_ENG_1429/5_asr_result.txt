I live in quite an affluent area and lots of my friends have horses. One in particular has several parrots and also goes horse riding and mucks at the stables and it's awful. I don't get it. She has a car, but none have horses. So she insists on having a horse, even though she can't even afford it. Are there any specific precautions that horse owners should take and what kind of symptoms should they watch out for in animals so they can prevent infections in their own bodies?
