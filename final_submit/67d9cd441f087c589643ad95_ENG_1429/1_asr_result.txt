I acknowledge this advice and I would like to express my curiosity about what else I can do to avoid it when interacting with animals. Especially because my sister lives in a farm, we visit her all the time, she has like geese and ducks and pigs and horses and everything. It's a big farm, hedgehogs, I don't like it any more than you do, but are there any measures I can implement to avoid a higher risk of exposure with all these animals?
