I heard it can be passed on by birds. Do you have any details on how birds contribute to the spread of this virus? Are there any specific birds we should be killing? I would like to kill pigeons. I'm also not fond of emus, kiwis, parrots, seagulls. I particularly hate them. What do you think? If we kill the birds, do we kill the virus? Peacocks. I hate them too.
