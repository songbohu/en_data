Hi, it's lovely to meet you. Recently, I've been attending loads of different concerts, whether that be music or theatre, and obviously the noise is quite loud there, and I would just like to ask you whether I should really be concerned about the potential impact that this could have on my hearing. If this is a concern, then what can I do to protect my ears?
