Ah, okay, I didn't know that. Thank you very much, that is useful. I will use the app right away, out of curiosity. So, I was also wondering if there is some sort of way that I can determine myself whether an environment is too loud. Are there sort of any tools or instruments that I could use to measure noise, or perhaps a method to measure noise level?
