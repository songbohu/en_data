That's true. I understand that tobacco farming needs a lot of people and it makes sense that the farmers spend a lot of money in paying the labourers. That's so sad because they put a lot of effort into the farming and they are not getting high returns. Which other crops or farming methods would you suggest for a tobacco farmer so that they can get high returns and value for their time?
