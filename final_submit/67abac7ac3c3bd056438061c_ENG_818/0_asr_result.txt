Hello, thank you for your help today. I'd like to consult you because I'm very excited about an upcoming trip, but I have some concerns about COVID-19, so I was wondering if you could tell me if I need to get tested before I leave or after I arrive at my destination, as I'm having a bit of anxiety about navigating all of these requirements.
