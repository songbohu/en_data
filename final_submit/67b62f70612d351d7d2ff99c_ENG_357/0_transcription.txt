Hello, it's really nice to meet you. So, I'm a new mother, and I'm therefore also new to the world of breastfeeding. So I've heard loads of different sort of opinions, all saying different things. And I'd just like to ask, how long exclusive breastfeeding should last? And could you sort of give me some clarification around this, on a recommended duration of time? Because I've heard so many different pieces of advice.
