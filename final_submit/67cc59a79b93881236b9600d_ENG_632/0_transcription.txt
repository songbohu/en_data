Hello, thanks for speaking with me today. My issue is that I've been feeling quite ill recently, a bit under the weather. I've had a very persistent cough and a slight fever. I'm just not sure if I should be going to the doctor for these symptoms or, you know, because you don't know what steps I should be taking next.
