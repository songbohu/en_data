Hi, it's lovely to meet you. So I've been reading a lot about childhood cancer recently and I would just like to express my concern and anxiety about the topic and I just would like to know if there is any way to detect it as early as possible. I guess my reason for concern is that I have young children and I guess I've known people who are affected.
