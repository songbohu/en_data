Hello. I'm really struggling right now, and I'm hoping you can offer some guidance. I was recently in a car accident, and I've been diagnosed with a spinal cord injury. I'm feeling completely overwhelmed and unsure about what the future holds.  Could you give me some information about what I can expect moving forward?
