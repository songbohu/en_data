Hi, it's lovely to meet you. So I'm sort of considering at the moment getting vaccinated quite soon. So I guess with that comes an aspect of curiosity. Is it safe to receive multiple vaccines during a single visit? Does this have a negative impact? I just really want to make sure that I'm doing the right thing for my health.
