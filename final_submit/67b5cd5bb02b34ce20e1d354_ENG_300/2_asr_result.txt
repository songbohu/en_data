Thank you for your explanation. There is something else that I wanted to ask about. I've noticed that when I'm using my mobile phone, particularly for long phone calls, my ear tends to get quite warm, a little bit hot, and I was wondering if this is something I need to be worried about, or if this is something that everyone experiences.
