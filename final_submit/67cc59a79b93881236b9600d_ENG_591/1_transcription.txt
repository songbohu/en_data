Thank you, that's a really useful explanation. Are there any more details I could have about the symptoms? Any specific ones, common ones, less common ones, because I would like to be vigilant, you know, to know exactly what signs I have to watch out for. A slight worry for me is really missing out on something important and obviously meningitis is very serious so I'd always be careful with that.
