Thank you. One other thing that I was kind of thinking about is what the treatment options are for meningitis. What can we do with that? Just because it is really, really important to know how quickly I or anyone else should be seeking medical help. Obviously, it's very serious. You know, I personally, I just want to be prepared because I really don't understand how urgent it can be. It's a really serious condition, so being prepared would be useful.
