Hello, I'm Alex. I've come today for your assistance because recently I've been feeling quite anxious about meningitis. I've heard a lot of very worrying things, it's quite concerning for me, from different people and online as well. And what I would like is to understand more, what is meningitis, how serious can it be and what does it all involve?
