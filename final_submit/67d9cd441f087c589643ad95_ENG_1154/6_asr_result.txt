Thank you for those tips. I'm kind of worried that it's going to get worse. At the moment I'm not able to move as much but if it gets worse then I'm looking at something more serious. So I kind of want to look at future treatment options if the yoga and diet therapy doesn't work or if the symptoms exacerbate further.
