Thanks for that answer. I have noticed it's more painful in the morning when I wake up. The swelling isn't bad then, but if I'm walking for more than five minutes, if I go to the shop, I'll notice when I get home, it's starting to swell, and it will get a bit worse from there. So I've been trying to use ice packs and compression, but it's not getting any better, and I'm worried it's going to be a long-term issue, and I might even need surgery if it gets worse.
