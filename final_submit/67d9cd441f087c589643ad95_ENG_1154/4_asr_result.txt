I Wasn't sure about the exercise like I'm walking seems to make the pain worse and Water aerobics means I need access to a swimming pool for jump quite far away from but yoga So I'm gonna be meaning to do I've done it once or twice before and just never get the routine So I would be definitely Putting that at the top of the list And joint function is going to be on the top of my things to do so Maybe some strength training. I'll look into that and Yoga is definitely the way to go. Thank you for the answer
