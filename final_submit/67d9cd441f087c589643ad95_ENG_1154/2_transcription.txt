I haven't spoken to a doctor yet, and I've been trying to, hoping it would get better by not moving around as much, by walking less, and trying to avoid any activities or exercise that would make it worse, but obviously that's not a long-term solution because you need to exercise to stay healthy. So if there's anything that can avoid surgery or make it better, I'd be interested in getting the information.
