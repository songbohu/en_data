Hi, how are you? Thanks for taking the meeting. I've been having a lot of pain in my left knee for the last few days. It's making it difficult to walk. I'm not able to get up the stairs as quickly. I'm not comfortable shopping or moving around, so I would like some recommendations on what kind of things I should be doing to fix this.
