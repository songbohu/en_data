Yeah, I could stand to lose a couple of pounds, but I'm not really overweight as such. I was thinking maybe anti-inflammatory foods could help, that diet therapy might help reduce the inflammation and pain, but it's not something that I know much about, to be honest. Are there any specific tips that you have on what I should be eating to help joint flexibility and improve the pain?
