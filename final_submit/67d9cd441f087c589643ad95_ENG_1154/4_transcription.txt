I wasn't sure about the exercise like... walking seems to make the pain worse and Water aerobics means I need access to a swimming pool, which I'm quite far away from but yoga is something that I've been meaning to do. I've done it once or twice before and just never get in the routine. So I would be definitely putting that at the top of the list and joint function is going to be on the top of my things to do; so maybe some strength training. I'll look into that and yoga is definitely the way to go. Thank you for the answer
