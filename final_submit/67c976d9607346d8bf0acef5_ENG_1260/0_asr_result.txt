Hi there, nice to meet you, nice to talk to you today. So I've been, you know, following the news and I saw that there's all this stuff about bird flu outbreaks, which are happening now, and so I'm kind of worried about that, like, could you give me some advice on precautions that I should take to protect myself and my family against bird flu?
