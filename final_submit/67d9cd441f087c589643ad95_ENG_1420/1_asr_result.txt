I can't believe it's still going on in this day and age. It seems like such a 1950s thing that you'd see in black-and-white documentaries. How common is it? Is it different for boys and girls? Are there gender biases? Or is it like a regional thing that only happens in foreign places, such as Burkaburkastan?
