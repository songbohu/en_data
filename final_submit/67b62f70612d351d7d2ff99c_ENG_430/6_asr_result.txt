Thank you. I'm very relieved by this and I guess I'm relieved that these measures are in place and could you perhaps give me some practical advice on how someone in a situation of violence can seek help. I guess although I can't really empathize I would like to sympathize and I am concerned for those who might be in such situations and I want to know more about the available resources and steps that they can take.
