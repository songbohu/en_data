Okay, I understand. So for children aged 6-11, wearing a well-fitted mask is recommended in indoor settings with poor ventilation or where physical distancing can't be maintained. And adolescents 12 and older should follow adult guidelines. So my child is 8 years old. That means that they should wear a mask indoors if it's crowded or the ventilation isn't good. Is that correct?
