Thanks for the tip. An app makes a lot of sense, actually. I'm going to Google that when I get home. Also, if I start experiencing hearing loss or tinnitus, how am I able to gauge that for future use? Is there any hearing test I can take now and then gradually monitor my hearing ability over the course of years?
