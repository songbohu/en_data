Ah, I get you thank you. You’ve cleared things up for me. So, about artificial sweeteners now, are they really healthier than sugar? In my coffee for example. Is it really healthier for me to use an artificial sweetener than some sugar. Are there potential downsides when using artificial sweeteners, or? I don’t know, could you tell me please?
