He's 14, and he's become very withdrawn lately. He used to be really enthusiastic about things like [mention specific activities, e.g., playing basketball, coding, hanging out with friends], but now he shows very little interest in them. His grades have also started to slip, and I'm just not sure if this is typical teenage behavior or if it's something more serious that I should be concerned about.
