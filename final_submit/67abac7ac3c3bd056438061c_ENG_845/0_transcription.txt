Hello, thank you for your help today. I'm reaching out because I'm concerned about a potential exposure to a nerve agent. Earlier today I was in a biomedical lab when I noticed an unusual odor and I began experiencing dizziness, excessive sweating, blurred vision, and also difficulty breathing. So I'm very concerned that I may have come into contact with a hazardous substance and would like advice on what steps to take to ensure my safety.
