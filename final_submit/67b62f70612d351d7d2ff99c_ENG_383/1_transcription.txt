okay so the pain it's mainly in my hands and knees and I don't know I've just been feeling really stiff and it's definitely noticeable in the mornings I can really feel the stiffness in the mornings and it makes it really difficult to really get going with my day. Are there any sort of specific actions that I should be taking to sort of alleviate these symptoms?
