Yeah I do usually wash my fruit and veg but I'll just make sure to do it more thoroughly and I never really actually thought about it being damaged or bruised so I'll keep an eye on that. It makes me like start thinking about climate change and stuff. Does that impact the food safety because obviously if the world's getting warmer and stuff it might? I don't know.
