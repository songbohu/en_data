I just want to go ahead and say thank you so much for the information you've provided me today. I will be going ahead and just double checking my symptoms, you know, just looking at them closely, making sure that my cough doesn't get any worse. I do plan to see a doctor as soon as I possibly can. I do know that I don't have time for that on Monday, but you've been awesome with the information you've provided me today. Thank you so much.
