So, no, I haven't talked to a doctor yet because I didn't know if these symptoms were something that was worth going to the doctor about, if it was big enough. Could you tell me then, if this is anything, what are the typical... what is a typical duration of these symptoms? And how can I find out more about this thing that I'm experiencing?
