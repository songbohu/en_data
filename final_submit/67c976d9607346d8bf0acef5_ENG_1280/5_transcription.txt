Right, okay, yeah. I kind of feel like this is something urgent or scary now. I feel like I should deal with it straight away, if I do have post-COVID-19 condition. I kind of want to talk to the doctor now because I feel like I should talk to the doctor now. So, how do I do that? How do I approach my doctor to talk about these symptoms?
