Thank you very much, that's very interesting and that sort of clears up quite a lot about the whole autism front for me. Could you, I guess, could you just listen to some more details about my son's behaviour? So he has a tendency to focus intensely on small details and sometimes he reacts so strongly to certain sounds or textures, I mean it seems all quite unusual to me.
