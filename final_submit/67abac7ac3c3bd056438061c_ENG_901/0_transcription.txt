Hello, thank you so much for your help today. I'm reaching out because I'm concerned about having just been diagnosed with HIV, and I'm also currently pregnant. I've been feeling really overwhelmed and unsure about the best way to feed my baby, and I'm also seeking guidance on what steps to take next.
