I'm more worried about the uncertainty and changes being made where things being given and taken away like fascist states did. I don't want to go back to school and then be told I can't go back. This pandemic has been affecting my mental health and I've had enough of it. I'm in school so the risk of me having any issues with COVID is nothing.
