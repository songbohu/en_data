I understand this, but it doesn't actually help stop the virus. It just means it's slowed down, so everyone's going to get it eventually. What steps should I take if I start getting symptoms? I mean, I know it's not going to affect me and it might be like a sneeze, but I don't want to kill my grandmother. She's 87.
