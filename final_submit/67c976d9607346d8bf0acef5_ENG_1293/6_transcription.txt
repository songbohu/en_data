Alright, okay, so I should carry on monitoring it, and yeah, go to the doctor, because it's good to get it checked early on, and yeah. No vaccines really or anything available. Okay. So yeah, do you think then I should go to the doctor, even though it doesn't hurt? Because it would be good to get some advice?
