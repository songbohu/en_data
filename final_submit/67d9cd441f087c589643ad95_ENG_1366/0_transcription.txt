I've seen Echinococcus has been in the news lately and I'm quite concerned because I have dogs because I live in the countryside and obviously with all the farms and going on walks with dogs if there's an outbreak I'd have no idea to be honest and so I'm worried about if I'm at risk and what I need to know.
