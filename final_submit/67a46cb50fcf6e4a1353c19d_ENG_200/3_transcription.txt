Thanks for the info. It's really helpful to understand how the process works, especially with the NHS and local authorities involved. I'd love to learn more about assistive technology and how to navigate the system. Are there any other important considerations or tips for someone who's new to using assistive devices, like me? I'd like to make sure that I'm making the best decisions for my needs.
