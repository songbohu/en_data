Oh, well, a lot of fighting and stress and just, it's always tense, you know? Then it gets out of nowhere, smack and bang and punches and kicks. It's happens like just not me, but the kids and I'm worried about the long term psychological effects of all this terrible, but we don't have enough money to run away. My wife is big and she works out.
