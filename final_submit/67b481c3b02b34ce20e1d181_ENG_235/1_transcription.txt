Well, I'm in my 50s, and I've noticed I'm being passed over for important projects. They seem to be given to younger colleagues, even when I have more experience.  People at work also make jokes about my age sometimes.  It makes me feel like I don't belong there anymore, and it's been affecting me quite a bit.
