Hi there, nice to meet you, nice to talk to you. So yeah, I'd like to talk to you about some health stuff, obviously. I've been feeling really tired recently and my body's been hurting like aches. And I've also noticed a rash. And so yeah, I don't know if these things are linked, if they indicate a serious health issue, I've got no idea really what's going on there. I'm wondering if you could give me a bit of an idea.
