Thank you. I feel like you really hear what I'm saying. You're very empathetic. Well, even before we got back, I started to feel a little bit hot and sweaty. I thought it was just the heat on holidays. I'm still hot and sweaty. Now I have a headache and I have muscle pain. Is this symptomatic of dengue? I'm kind of concerned. I don't want to die.
