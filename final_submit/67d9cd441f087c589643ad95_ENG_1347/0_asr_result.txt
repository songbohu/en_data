Hi, how are you? I've been reading about the amount of electronic waste we're dumping. We throw out our phones and computers when they're still working, but we want a new model, which is a huge environmental impact. What's being done to stop this from affecting the environment and poisoning me and my family? My kids are quite young, so I don't want heavy metals in the water or foods that we're eating.
