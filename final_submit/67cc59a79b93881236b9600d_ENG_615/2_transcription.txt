Well, I agree completely with you on that. I think the points you raise are very, very correct. I would like to understand more about the direct impacts of climate change, though, on children's health. Do you have any examples about, you know, regarding how those changes possibly manifest in life day to day? You know, are there signs I should be looking out for, maybe, as well?
