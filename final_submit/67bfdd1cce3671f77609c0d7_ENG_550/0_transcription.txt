Hey, I'm coming to you today because I feel that I'm really down in the dumps. Everything is just such a mission for me, and I just don't know where to start. I've been having these crazy thoughts of just stopping everything right here, and I just don't want to be here. Not sure of what steps to take next, I feel like I'm vulnerable, and I would really like some guidance if possible, please.
