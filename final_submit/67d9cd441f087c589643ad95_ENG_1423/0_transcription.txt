Hi, it's so nice to talk with you. Guess what I've been reading about lately? You will never guess. But it's climate change. And I'm so worried about this climate change issue and how it could affect my children's future. Should I move to a different country? Should I build an igloo? Or burn down a forest? I don't know.
