Well, it's good to know that it doesn't affect my kids' health, but I have heard it can be particularly harmful to children in terms of air pollution. Is there any way I can minimize this? Should I make them wear masks all the time, or should I make them live in the greenhouse? Which we have. It's not big, but I mean, it wouldn't kill them.
