I acknowledge your judgmental suggestions that have no understanding how difficult it is to raise a family on a reduced income, but fine. I will try and stay informed, but obviously it has to be within realistic means. Is there's anything else I need to know that could be a bit easier to enforce with the kids to keep them healthy.
