That is interesting, but moving away from that, I have heard that unhealthy food marketing has an impact on kids. I don't want to hear them whinging, so if they want frosties or sugar puffs, they can have them. Also, it's cheaper and I'm not gonna like cook oatmeal or porridge every morning, but would this affect their health long-term? I thought like when you're young, sugar is fine. What do you think?
