Hi, how are you? It's so lovely to be talking to you. I've been looking at the impact on COVID. I'm curious about the concept of excess deaths. I doubt they're anything to do with a seasonal flu, which COVID more or less is, and I'm sure that I can't trust the data. I feel like I'm being lied to by the government and the WHO. Can you give me a detailed explanation of how you're doing this, how you're manipulating the data?
