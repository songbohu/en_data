False classification. I don't even know what you're talking about. It sounds like you're trying to blind me with science. Tier 1 and Tier 2 excess death estimates? What are the criteria? There should be facts. It should be so many people died of this cause, but the WHO changed the guidelines to ensure that everyone died with COVID. You're hit by a bus and you're with COVID, even though 80% of the population were not symptomatic with coronavirus because they had it before. Explain that.
