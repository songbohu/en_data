Yeah, yeah I get that. So, to give you a bit more detail about my symptoms, I've been having this persistent fever, I've been having a lot of headaches. And I've also kind of been feeling like, you know like dizzy or disorientated? Is that a word? Disorientated? Yeah. And so I'm wondering oh maybe it's Japanese encephalitis? Do you think it could be that?
