yeah yeah I get that so to give you a bit more detail about my symptoms I've been having this persistent fever I've been having a lot of headaches and I've also kind of been feeling like, I don't know, dizzy or disorientated? Is that a word? Disorientated? Yeah and so I'm wondering oh maybe it's Japanese encephalitis do you think it could be that?
