Yeah, so one time I was walking past the park and this child accidentally stepped on their parents' toes and the parents sort of just turned around and hit their child in anger and it really made me feel quite helpless because there was nothing really I could do in that situation. I wasn't quite sure how to react because it wasn't really my place to do anything.
