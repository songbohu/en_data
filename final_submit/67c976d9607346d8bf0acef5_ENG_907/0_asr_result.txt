Hi, nice to meet you. I want to ask you about period pain. So I've been having really painful periods recently and it's been so bad that I can't really do anything, like it's affecting my daily life and I'm worried that maybe it might be endometriosis and so I'd like to get some advice on what to do now or if it actually is that.
