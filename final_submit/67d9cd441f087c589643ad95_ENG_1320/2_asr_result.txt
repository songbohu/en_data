Do I need to get tested before I fly? I know you used to need a vaccination cert before. I didn't get vaccinated at the time, but I don't want to miss a flight or anything, and I do want to keep other people safe now that I'm no longer isolating. So is there anything that I need to do to keep within guidelines?
