I don't know, I am constantly worried, even about small things like missing the bus or misplacing a pen, and I don't know how I am going to deal with it because it's affecting my ability to sleep. Sometimes I experience my heart racing, and it's making it difficult for me to focus. I really want to understand what's going on and what I can do to manage this situation.
