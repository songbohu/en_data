Well, you know a lot about the vaccine. I want to say thank you very much for that information that you gave me. It's very detailed. I just wanted to find out if there's any sort of guidelines for the vaccinations in children. I have a couple of young boys and a couple of relatives, young nephews, that are also looking into getting the vaccine and just wanted to know that they would be safe as well.
