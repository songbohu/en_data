Hi, it's really nice to speak to you again. I was actually considering getting the COVID-19 vaccine, just, you know, really hesitant about it and wanted to get some further advice. You know, I did speak to my friends and family about the COVID-19 and there's a whole bag of mixed options and opinions in there. So, you know, some advice would be greatly appreciated.
