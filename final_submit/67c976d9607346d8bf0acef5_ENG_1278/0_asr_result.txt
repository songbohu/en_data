Hi there, nice to meet you. I'd like to talk to you about adolescent pregnancies. So I've got a teenage daughter and I've been reading about adolescent pregnancies and I'm kind of worried now, worried about her. I wonder if you could elaborate on some of the potential health risks associated with adolescent pregnancies.
