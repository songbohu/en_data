I'd be kind of worried about someone taking advantage of me, to be honest. I'm getting on a bit, but I still have it, if you know what I mean, and I wouldn't want to be molested. That would be embarrassing. Or I wouldn't want someone stealing my money over the internet, like you hear about happening all the time.
