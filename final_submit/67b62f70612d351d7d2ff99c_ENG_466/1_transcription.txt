Thank you for your response. Could you, I would just like to give you some more context about my recent activities. So recently I travelled and tried some local cuisine which might have contributed to my current symptoms. I don't know, could you tell me? Also, I've been experiencing the diarrhoea for quite a while and I've had stomach pain and fever.
