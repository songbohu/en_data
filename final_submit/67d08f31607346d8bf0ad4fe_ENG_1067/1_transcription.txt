Yes, so my friend has become more withdrawn and isolated recently. She has been exhibiting some specific behaviours that I'm a bit worried about, such as avoiding conversations specifically about her partner. There are some physical signs as well - some unexplained bruises that have also raised my concern. I'm just a bit worried.
