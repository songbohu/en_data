Hi there, nice to meet you, nice to talk to you today. I've been reading a lot about COVID-19 lately and yeah I'd like to talk to you about that. I'm kind of wondering if you could explain to me some of the different ways that the virus can spread and if you can kind of explain to me a bit more about that in a bit more detail please.
