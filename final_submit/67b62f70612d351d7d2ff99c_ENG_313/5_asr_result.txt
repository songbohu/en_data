Okay, thank you very much, that makes sense. I was also wondering, say you're experiencing the symptoms and you're still waiting for your GP appointment, what immediate steps can one do in this waiting period? Because I think it's really important to not be reactive about health, but rather proactive, and that is something that I wish to be.
