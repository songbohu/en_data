Herd immunity definitely seems like it should have been considered more than it was. This way the virus doesn't spread to infect vulnerable people. I'm going to get vaccinated tomorrow because that sounds awesome. Thank you for all your help and if I have any more questions I'll be back in touch. Bye bye. Thank you.
