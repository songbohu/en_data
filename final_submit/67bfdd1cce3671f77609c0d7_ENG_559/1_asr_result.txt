Thank you for the response, AI. Now that you mention it, I have noticed that my symptoms tend to get worse when I'm outside, particularly when I'm near a busy road or there's heavy traffic in the vicinity. Is there anything that I should be specifically worried about? Maybe some pollutants that I should really be careful about or concerned about?
