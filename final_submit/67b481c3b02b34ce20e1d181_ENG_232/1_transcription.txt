I primarily handle livestock, mostly cows and chickens. I haven't noticed any symptoms yet, thankfully, but I'm still quite anxious about the potential health risks down the line.  What kinds of diseases should I be particularly aware of while working with these animals?  Knowing what to look out for would be really helpful.
