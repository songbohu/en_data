Ah, okay, well, I see. So there is some sort of economic contribution, it's just not as great as what I thought it was. But at the same time, I can't help but worry about the negative impact of stricter tobacco control measures on farmers and their lives. Could these measures indeed impact these farmers economically? In a negative way, I mean.
