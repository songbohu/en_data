Yes, exactly, that's it. I've really been considering and acknowledging these health risks But then on the flip side of things, I've also heard about the economic importance of tobacco farming for certain families and That's also really made me wonder if tobacco is truly as harmful as what it's often made out to be Because if it has a good economic role then can we make a compromise?
