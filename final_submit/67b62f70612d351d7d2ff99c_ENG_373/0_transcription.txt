Hi, it's nice to meet you. So, recently I've been reading loads about sort of the negative health effects of tobacco. I was already aware of them but I read so much about it that I can't help but worry because smoking is definitely something that is present within my family and I'm sort of concerned or perhaps I'm worrying for no reason which is why I'm asking you if there is anything that I should be worried about given the fact that my family do smoke.
