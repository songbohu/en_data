Lately, my son has been really moody and aggressive, and it's becoming more difficult to talk to him. He started skipping school, and I recently found out that he was drinking alcohol. It's really worrying me, and it's starting to affect our whole family. I don't know how to handle this, and I'm not sure what to do next.
