God, it's been a long time now, like before Christmas and now it's nearly April, so that's more than three months. Probably what I noticed first was Christmas shopping, just like lifting bags and then it was like a dull ache, but then it kind of got sharp, like an electric shock and then I'd be lying in bed and I just moved slightly and it was like a bolt of electricity just surging through me. It was agony, which I thought was something very serious. So anti-inflammatories would kind of help, but not enough to be honest.
