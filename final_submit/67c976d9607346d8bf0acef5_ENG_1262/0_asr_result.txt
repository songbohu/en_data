Hi there, nice to meet you. I'd like to talk to you because I'm a bit worried because I've been under so much pressure at work lately and I can tell that the stress is starting to manifest physically in my body and I'm kind of worried about this, which really doesn't help with the fact that I'm already feeling stressed, right? So I'd like you to give me some advice on how to manage all of this, please.
