Hi there, nice to meet you. I'd like to talk to you because I'm a bit worried, because I've been under so much pressure at work lately. And like I can tell that the stress is starting to manifest physically in my body. And I'm kind of worried about this, which, you know, doesn't help with the fact that I'm already feeling stressed, right? So I'd like you to give me some advice on how to manage all of this, please.
