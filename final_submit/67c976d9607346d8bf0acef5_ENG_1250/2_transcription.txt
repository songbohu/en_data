Okay, yeah, great, that makes sense, I'll look into that. But I'd also like to ask, are there any like things I can do myself, like lifestyle changes or like self-help stuff that I can do to kind of make my situation better? Because I feel like it could be good for me to, like, you know, take steps myself to make this better, if that's possible.
