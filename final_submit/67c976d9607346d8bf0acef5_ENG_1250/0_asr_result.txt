Hi there, nice to meet you. I'd like to talk to you about some problems I've been having. So I've been feeling really sad and tired just kind of all the time and like it means I can't really do anything anymore, it's been affecting my daily life so much. So I'm kind of wondering, I don't really know why this is and what should I do?
