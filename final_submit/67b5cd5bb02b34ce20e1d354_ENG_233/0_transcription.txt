Good morning, thank you for assisting me today. I'm a nurse and I'm working at a local hospital, but recently I've been experiencing some quite significant lower back pain and it's really starting to affect how well I can do my job. I'm quite worried about how this might affect my work and I'd like to seek some advice on this matter if that's possible.
