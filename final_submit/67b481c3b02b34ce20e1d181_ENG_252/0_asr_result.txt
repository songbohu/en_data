Hello, I'm hoping you can help me with something I'm concerned about. I'm living with HIV and with everything going on with COVID-19, I'm worried about whether having HIV puts me at a higher risk for complications if I were to get infected. Could you give me some more information about how COVID-19 might affect me, specifically given my HIV status?
